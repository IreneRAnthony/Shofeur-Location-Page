# Shofeur Location Page
 With my limited time to work, I decided to go for a more simple design, that admittedly could use a little more tweaking and spacing if I was able to do so. I opted to use Tailwind CSS, as well as Daisy CSS to save time and energy, as the sleek components of the two are both useful and stylish in terms of UI creation. And with the definite needed components of the map, and the general info of the location, I also opted to use a carousel to display photos, to help show the destination off. An accordion design was used to help with spacing for displaying the available cars, and a filter can also be created in the future to better help customers find what they are searching for. Overall I thought sleek was best, with minimal styling, and using the sites already decided pallette of netural darks and grey, and add that vibrant amber for the color pop.
